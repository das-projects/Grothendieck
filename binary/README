This directory contains static files used to construct DSL binary tarballs.

The major components are:
  1) modified versions of delitec/delite/delitecommon for the binary distribution
  2) an SBT jar to be distributed with the DSL
  3) a custom SBT project file for the binary distribution

All of the components, as well as the script build-dsl-binaries.sh, are dependent on
the version of Scala and SBT used in the submodules and DSLs.

If these change, build-dsl-binaries.sh and the files in this directory must be
updated accordingly! Similarly, if the delite* scripts are substantively changed,
the versions here must also be updated. We should explore generalizing the scripts
to avoid this redundancy.
